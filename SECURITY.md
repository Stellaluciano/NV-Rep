# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

NV-Rep is currently in active research development. Security updates are provided on a best-effort basis for the latest default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** disclose security vulnerabilities publicly.

Instead, report issues privately by contacting the maintainers with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline.
